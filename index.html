      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <div class="topic">
        <p>TypeScript stands in an unusual relationship to JavaScript. TypeScript offers all of JavaScript’s features,
          and an additional layer on top of these: TypeScript’s type system.</p>
        <p>Using types, TypeScript requires consistent assignment of variables in your code. This helps to highlight
          unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="topic" id="intro1">
        <h3>Types by Inference</h3>

        <p>The code below assigns helloWorld to a string "Hello World". This code works in both JavaScript and
          TypeScript, but in TypeScript helloWorld is specifically a string type now. This auto assignment of the
          variable's type helps to reduces extra characters and code to make types explicit.</p>

        <code class="code">
          let helloWorld = "Hello World";
        </code>
      </div>

      <div class="topic" id="intro2">
        <h3>Defining Types</h3>
        <p>TypeScript offers a variety of ways to define a variables type.</p>
        <p>For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes name: string and id: number, you can
          write:</p>

        <code class="code">
            const user = { <br>
            name: "Hayes", <br>
            id: 0, <br>
            };
        </code>

        <p>You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an interface declaration:</p>

        <code class="code">
          interface User { <br>
          name: string;<br>
          id: number;<br>
          }
        </code>

        <p>You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new interface by using syntax
          like : TypeName after a variable declaration:</p>

        <code class="code">
          const user: User = { <br>
            name: "Hayes", <br>
            id: 0, <br>
          };
        </code>

        <p>If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:</p>

        <code class="code">
          interface User {<br>
            name: string;<br>
            id: number;<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          const user: User = {<br>
            username: "Hayes",<br>
            <span style="background-color: darkred">Type '{ username: string; id: number; }' is not assignable to type 'User'.<br>
            Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'username' does not exist in type 'User'.<br> </span>
            id: 0,<br>
          };
        </code>

        <p>Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an
          interface declaration with classes:</p>

        <code class="code">
          interface User {<br>
            name: string;<br>
            id: number;<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          class UserAccount {<br>
            name: string;<br>
            id: number;<br>
            <br>
            constructor(name: string, id: number) {<br>
              this.name = name;<br>
              this.id = id;<br>
            }<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);
        </code>

        <p>You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions</p>

        <code class="code">
          function getAdminUser(): User {<br>
            //...<br>
          }<br>
           
          function deleteUser(user: User) {<br>
            // ...<br>
          }<br>
        </code>

        <p>There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: boolean, bigint, null, number,
          string, symbol, and undefined, which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few
          more, such as <strong>any</strong> (allow anything), <strong>unknown</strong> (ensure someone using this type
          declares what the type is), <strong>never</strong>
          (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and <strong>void</strong> (a function which returns undefined
          or has no return
          value)</p>
        <p>You’ll see that there are two syntaxes for building types: Interfaces and Types. You should prefer interface.
          Use type when you need specific features</p>
      </div>

      <div class="topic" id="intro3">
        <h3>Composing Types</h3>

        <p>With TypeScript, complex types can be created by combining simple ones using <strong>unions</strong> and
          <strong>generics</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Unions</h4>

        <p>Unions allow creation of a type that can be one of many types.</p>
        <p>A popular use of unions is to describe string or number literals, similar to that of Enum's in Java.</p>

        <code class="code">
          type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized"; <br>
          type LockStates = "locked" | "unlocked"; <br>
          type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9; 
        </code>

        <p>Unions also provide a way to handle different types, like for example being either an array or a string.</p>

        <code class="code">
          function getLength(obj: string | string[]) { <br>
            return obj.length; <br>
          } 
        </code>

        <p>To learn the type of a variable, use <strong>typeof</strong>.</p>

        <code class="code">
          function wrapInArray(obj: string | string[]) { <br>
            if (typeof obj === "string") <br>
              return [obj]; <br>
            return obj; <br>
          }
        </code>

        <h4>Generics</h4>

        <p>Generics provide variables to types. A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain
          anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.</p>

        <code class="code">
          interface Backpack&ltType&gt { <br>
            add: (obj: Type) =&gt void; <br>
            get: () =&gt Type; <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          // This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a <br>
          // constant called `backpack`, and to not worry about where it came from. <br>
          declare const backpack: Backpack&ltstring&gt; <br>
            <br>
          // object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack. <br>
          const object = backpack.get(); <br>
          <br>
          // Since the backpack variable is a string, you can't pass a number to the add function. <br>
          backpack.add(23); <br>
          <span style="background-color: darkred">Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.</span>
        </code>
      </div>

      <div class="topic" id="intro4">
        <h3>Structural Type System</h3>

        <p>In TypeScript, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.</p>
        <p>In the code below, <em>point</em> is never declared to be of Point type, but it has the same shape as a Point
          type, so the code passes.</p>

        <code class="code">
          interface Point { <br>
            x: number; <br>
            y: number; <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          function logPoint(p: Point) { <br>
            console.log(`${p.x}, ${p.y}`); <br>
          } <br>
          <br>
          // logs "12, 26" <br>
          const point = { x: 12, y: 26 }; <br>
          logPoint(point);
        </code>

        <p>There is no difference between how classes and objects conform to shapes. If the object or class has all the
          required properties, TypeScript will say they match, regardless of the implementation details.</p>

      <h2>The Basics</h2>

      <div class="topic">
        <p>Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can observe from running different operations.
          That sounds abstract, but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a variable named
          message.</p>

        <code class="code">
          // Accessing the property 'toLowerCase' <br>
          // on 'message' and then calling it <br>
          message.toLowerCase(); <br>
          // Calling 'message' <br>
          message();
        </code>

        <p>If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a property called toLowerCase and then calls
          it. The second one tries to call message directly.</p>
        <p>But assuming we don’t know the value of message - and that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what
          results we’ll get from trying to run any of this code. The behavior of each operation depends entirely on what
          value we had in the first place.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Is message callable?</li>
          <li>Does it have a property called toLowerCase on it?</li>
          <li>If it does, is toLowerCase even callable?</li>
          <li>If both of these values are callable, what do they return?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The answers to these questions are usually things we keep in our heads when we write JavaScript, and we have
          to hope we got all the details right.</p>
        <p>Let’s say message was defined in the following way</p>

        <code class="code">
          const message = "Hello World!";
        </code>

        <p>As you can probably guess, if we try to run message.toLowerCase(), we’ll get the same string only in
          lower-case.</p>
        <p>What about that second line of code? If you’re familiar with JavaScript, you’ll know this fails with an
          exception:</p>

        <code class="code">
          TypeError: message is not a function
        </code>

        <p>It’d be great if we could avoid mistakes like this.</p>
        <p>When we run our code, the way that our JavaScript runtime chooses what to do is by figuring out the type of
          the value - what sorts of behaviors and capabilities it has. That’s part of what that TypeError is alluding to
          - it’s saying that the string "Hello World!" cannot be called as a function.</p>
        <p>For some values, such as the primitives string and number, we can identify their type at runtime using the
          typeof operator. But for other things like functions, there’s no corresponding runtime mechanism to identify
          their types. For example, consider this function:</p>

        <code class="code">
          function fn(x){ <br>
          return x.flip(); <br>
          } <br>
        </code>

        <p>We can observe by reading the code that this function will only work if given an object with a callable flip
          property, but JavaScript doesn’t surface this information in a way that we can check while the code is
          running. The only way in pure JavaScript to tell what fn does with a particular value is to call it and see
          what happens. This kind of behavior makes it hard to predict what code will do before it runs, which means
          it’s harder to know what your code is going to do while you’re writing it</p>
        <p>Seen in this way, a type is the concept of describing which values can be passed to fn and which will crash.
          JavaScript only truly provides dynamic typing - running the code to see what happens.</p>
        <p>The alternative is to use a static type system to make predictions about what code is expected before it
          runs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="topic" id="basics1">
        <h3>Static type-checking</h3>

        <p>Think back to that TypeError we got earlier from trying to call a string as a function. Most people don’t
          like to get any sorts of errors when running their code - those are considered bugs! And when we write new
          code, we try our best to avoid introducing new bugs.</p>
        <p>If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and immediately see the error, we might be able
          to isolate the problem quickly; but that’s not always the case. We might not have tested the feature
          thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into a potential error that would be thrown! Or if we were
          lucky enough to witness the error, we might have ended up doing large refactorings and adding a lot of
          different code that we’re forced to dig through.</p>
        <p>Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs before our code runs. That’s what a static
          type-checker like TypeScript does. Static types systems describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values
          will be when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when
          things might be going off the rails.</p>

        <code class="code">
          const message = "hello!"; <br>
          <br>
          message(); <br>
          <span style="background-color: darkred">This expression is not callable. <br>
            Type 'String' has no call signatures.</span>
        </code>

        <p>Running that last sample with TypeScript will give us an error message before we run the code in the first
          place.</p>
